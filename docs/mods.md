# ONB DOCS
The [Lua][Lua] scripting language is used to make content for ONB.
To get started making your own creations, visit these 
community-created online docs:

 1. [Latest ONB 2.1 Docs][ONB_DOCS_2_1] by Alrysc.
 2. [ONB 2.0 Docs][ONB_DOCS_2_0] by Pion.\*

> Pion's docs are very rich in detail about how the engine works and is valuable reference material.

!!! NOTE
    Official documentation generated by in-house tools _in progress_.

# GET MODS
Open Net Battle is a decentralized community where anyone and everyone can host, share, and create their own mods.

This means there is no official repository for ONB mods, but very cool
people in the community have made and hosted their own solutions.

!!! CAUTION
    These websites are not affiliated directly nor managed by the ONB Team
    and you are advised to visit and download mods at your own discretion.

2. [Milk PET](https://milk.pet/mods)

# GET ASSETS
While not mods by the technical definition, these assets can replace client assets or be 
dropped directly into an ONB server with minimal integration.
