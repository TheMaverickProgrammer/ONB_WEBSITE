# ORIGINS
[Pheelbert](https://github.com/Pheelbert)'s SFML github project started everything.

James collaborated with Pheelbert up to the first version
of ONB which was also available on [android](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/open_mmbn_android).

ONB exists today [because of Pheelbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).
