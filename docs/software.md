# DEBUGGER
> WIP.

ONB Inspector is a custom remote debugging tool for the Client.

!!! note
    This is a **tool** for `2.5` which is in private development.

In older ONB Clients, a debug console window would popup at launch. This is no more. Now, custom debug tool allows creators to filter and search through logs in a comfortable and convenient user interface. Users will be able to toggle layer visibility in the new `2.5` renderer. Other tools are available to inspect frame data.
